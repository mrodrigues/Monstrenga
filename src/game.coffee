# ## Possible Experimentations:
# 
# The are lots of things to try out here.
# 
# 1. Modify level.json to change the level around and add in some more enemies.
# 2. Add in a second level by creating a level2.json and a level2 scene that gets
#    loaded after level 1 is complete.
# 3. Add in a title screen
# 4. Add in a hud and points for jumping on enemies.
# 5. Add in a `Repeater` behind the TileLayer to create a paralax scrolling effect.
